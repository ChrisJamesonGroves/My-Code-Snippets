# Visual Studio Code Snippets

The following are some useful code snippets to help speed up development.
The files must be put into your active VS user folder as follows:
```
C:\Users\[active user]\Documents\Visual Studio [VERSION]\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets
```
Currently code snippets are for creating XUnit code:

**xMock** will create an initial mock instance for adding the Interface to be mocked.

**xFact** will create an empty Xunit [Fact] method.
**xFactAsync** will create an empty Xunit [Fact] async method.

**xTheory** will create an empty Xunit [Theory] method.
**xTheoryAsync** will create an empty Xunit [Theory] async method.
